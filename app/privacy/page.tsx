        <h2 className="text-lg mb-5 mt-8 font-medium">Our Use of Google User Data</h2>
        <p className="mb-5">
          Our Mac Application Dropzone allows you to connect with your account
          on Google Drive. Dropzone uses OAuth to obtain a token to allow it to
          access your Google Drive solely for the purpose of allowing you to
          upload files into your own drive. None of your Google Drive data is
          stored by us or transmitted beyond your own machine by Dropzone. In
          some cases Dropzone may maintain an internal list of URLs for you to
          re-copy a link to file you uploaded earlier. This list is stored in a
          user preferences file on your own computer only. Dropzone also allows
          linking to a YouTube account - once again for the sole purpose of
          allowing you to upload videos to YouTube. No personal information
          obtained via Googles APIs is ever transmitted to us or any third party
          when using Dropzone.
